Hi there! I'm **Naveed Azhar**, an indie developer passionate about crafting **interactive and user-friendly web applications** using modern technologies.  I enjoy the entire creative process, from brainstorming ideas, designing smooth interfaces, to writing clean, maintainable code. My projects often explore new frameworks, experimental design patterns, and performance-focused architectures.  

Outside of coding, I love immersing myself in films, anime, and music, which often spark inspiration for my work.  Iâ€™m always curious about learning new tools, collaborating with other developers, and building products that feel both practical and fun.
